## **Statement of purpose**

This project is focused to creating a web application that allows students to buy or sell or rent books. Universities tend to distribute textbooks to students for their courses every year.  In case of shortage of books or damaged books or for other reasons, the university tends to ask students to purchase textbooks from other sources. At the end of the year, most of these books are sold on other websites after usage where students tend to recycle them. This project focuses on allowing students to sell these books to the university for a certain percentage of the actual retail price. So that universities can reuse those books instead of buying it from other sources.

## **Overview**

The overview of the project is to develop an application that allows students to check the books they want to buy, rent, or sell them to the institution. They will be given an appointment at their university library after filling out a form, where they will bring their book and sell it to the institution. These books can be looked up based on the student details like 919#, Subject, Semester. The students need to fill a form for buying, selling, and renting the books and make an appointment where the admin can accept or reject the appointment based on the availability of the book in the library.

## **Benefits**

•	Students can buy books easily in the library. 

•	This also allows the university to buy newer addition of textbooks in a short time span.

•	It allows students to buy or rent books easily.

•	Students who require these books for a short time period can get access easily.
 
## **Risks**

•	Students can only sell selected books which are required by the university.

•	University may not have all the books the student may require.

•	If the student took rent for a particular period, they need to return the book on time.

## **Assumptions**

•	Students can buy books from the library.

•	Students can sell books to the library.

•	Students can take books for rent from the library.

•	Students can access all the above information within the application.
