Statement of purpose

This project is focused to creating a web application that allows students to buy or sell or rent books. Universities tend to distribute textbooks to students for their courses every year.  If in case of shortage of books or damaged books or for other reasons, the university tends to ask students to purchase textbooks from other sources. At the end of the year, most of these books are sold on other websites after usage where students tend to recycle them. This project focuses on allowing students to sell these books to the university for a certain percentage of the actual retail price. So that universities can reuse those books instead of buying it from other sources.

Overview

The overview of the project is to develop an application that allows students to check the books they want to buy, rent, or sell them to the institution. They will be given an appointment at their university library after filling out a form, where they will bring their book and sell it to the institution. These books can be looked up based on the student details like Name, Subject, Semester. The students need to fill a form for buying, selling, and renting the books and make an appointment where the admin can accept or reject the appointment based on the availability of the book in the library.
